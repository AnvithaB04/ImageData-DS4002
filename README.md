# ImageData-DS4002

<!-- Project Overview -->
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is a **Pet Breed Classification** project. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify dog and cat breeds from images. The workflow covers **data organization**, **preprocessing**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.

### Key Features:
- **Data Organization**: Automatically sorts raw images into breed-specific folders  
- **Data Augmentation**: Applies rotations, flips, zooms, and brightness adjustments
