# ImageData-DS4002

<!-- Project Overview -->
## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **Pet Breed Classification** project. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify dog and cat breeds from images. The workflow covers **data organization**, **preprocessing**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.

### Key Features:
- **Data Organization**: Automatically sorts raw images into breed-specific folders  
- **Data Augmentation**: Applies rotations, flips, zooms, and brightness adjustments

## Section 3: Instructions for Reproducing Results
Follow these steps to reproduce our results:

1. **Create the Google Collab**  
   Under the SCRIPTS/AnalysisScripts folder you can find a file Model_Training_and_Evaluation.ipynb, upload this to Google Collab.

   For this assignment we connected to Google Collab's A100 GPU, which is from Collab Pro. Do not run the code yet.
2. **Collect & Prepare Data**   
   - Go to the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset website: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/  
     Download the “Images” archive (`images.tar.gz`) and extract its contents into the `DATA/InputData/` folder.
   - In your local IDE or terminal, run the organization script to sort raw images into breed subfolders and extract its contents in the `DATA/AnalysisData/` folder:  
     ```bash
     python ./SCRIPTS/DataCollectionScripts/data_organization.py
     ```  
   - Next, run the preprocessing script to resize, augment, normalize, and split the images:  
     ```bash
     python ./SCRIPTS/DataCollectionScripts/data_preprocessing.py
     ```
